# Todo simple App
<hr>
It consists of Front End (Angular) and Back End (Spring Boot) parts.
Implemented in a scope of my learning journey.

So, the Front end talks to the Back end though HTTP2 protocol.
Communication possible with a use of JWT token, since Spring Security is involved.

Username and password are hardcoded: 
- username: itkon
- password: pass

Back end part uses H2 embedded DB.
